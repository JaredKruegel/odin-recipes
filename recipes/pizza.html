        <h2 class="head">Description</h2>
        <p class="para">Oh boy I do like pizza. Doesn't everyone like pizza? I like pizza almost as much
            as I like writing descriptions about pizza.
        </p>

        <!--- For this one I got to do headers for different ingredients
        not much different, but its more or less the first time I had
        to be "intuitive" in this course -->
        <h2 class ="head">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="unorder">
            
            <h3 class ="subhead">Dough</h3>
            <li class ="ing">1 ¼ cups warm water </li>
            <li class ="ing">1 teaspoon active dry yeast </li>
            <li class ="ing">3 cups bread flour </li>
            <li class ="ing">1 ½ teaspoons fine salt </li>
            <li class ="ing">¼ cup olive oil, divided </li>

            <h3 class ="subhead">Sauce</h3>
            <li class ="ing">1 (28 ounce) can plain crushed tomatoes </li>
            <li class ="ing">1 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce (such as Don Peppino®) </li>

            <h3 class="subhead">Cheese</h3>
            <li class="ing">8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced </li>
            <li class="ing">¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="head">Directions</h2>
        <ol class="order">
            <li >Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li >Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li >Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li >Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
            <li >Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
            <li >Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li >Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li >Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
        </ol>
